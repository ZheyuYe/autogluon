Text Prediction
===============

For predicting the label (either categorical or numerical) of the text data, AutoGluon provides
a simple `fit()` function that  automatically produces high quality text predictionÂ models based
on pretrained networks. Here, the text data may contain sentences, short paragraphs, or multiple sentences.
A single call to `fit()` will train highly accurate neural networks on your provided text dataset,
automatically leveraging accuracy-boosting techniques such as using a
pretrained BERT/ALBERT/ELECTRA model and hyper-parameter optimization.
